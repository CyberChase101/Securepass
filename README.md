Explanation:

* The generate_password function takes two parameters: length (default value of 12) specifies the desired password length, and complex (default value of True) determines whether to include special characters or not.

* The characters variable holds the character pool for generating the password. By default, it includes lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation. If complex is set to False, it excludes special characters.

* The password variable is created by selecting random characters from the character pool using a list comprehension.

* Finally, the generated password is returned by the generate_password function.

* The user is prompted to enter the desired password length and whether they want to include special characters.

* The generate_password function is called with the provided length and complexity preference, and the generated password is stored in the password variable.

* The program displays the generated password to the user.

This Secure Password Generator Program uses Python's random module to generate random characters and string module to access character sets. By allowing user input for length and complexity, the program provides flexibility in generating secure passwords tailored to individual requirements.
